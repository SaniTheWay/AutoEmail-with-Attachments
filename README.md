# AutoEmail-with-Attachments
Sending email to a many people with Attachments Using Python\n
## My first project using python.
In this we use smtp.lib to send emails to a list of contacts present in a .txt file with attachments.
In that .txt file there are 2 detail about any subject 1st -> Name and 2nd-> Email.
Take two input from the user :
  1. extension of the attachment.
  2. sender's email address.
 In program I gave the contact file path and the attachment folder path.
 Using this I can send email to many people and the attachment should have the same name as the name of the recipient.
 Your Suggestions will be welcomed!!!!
