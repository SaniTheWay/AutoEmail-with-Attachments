## Automating Email sending with attachments
---
The aim of this project to help person in sending bulk emails with attachments and help to save some precious time in sending email to many people at a time.

### First Project❤️

Here I used *smtp.lib* to send emails to a list of contacts present in a .txt file with attachments.

In that .txt file there are 2 detail about any subject one is **Name** and second is **mail id**.

Takeing two input from the user :

  1. Extension of the attachment (here I use png file attachment).
  
  2. Sender's email address.

  In program, I gave the *contact file path* and the attachment *folder path*.

👉Attachments should have the same name as the name of the recipient.
  
Using this you can send email to many people in one go.📤

Any thing that I did wrongly or it can be optimize, so feel free to raise Issues.

Your Suggestions will be welcomed!
